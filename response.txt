You're having some trouble with video, audio & media in HTML. I'd be happy to help!

The concept of using SVG files not showing up is actually covered in Video #10. To clarify, at around 0:49 (or 416.08 seconds into the video), you'll see a demonstration where an SVG file isn't displaying as expected.

If that doesn't make sense or if you're still having issues, feel free to ask and I can try to provide further assistance!
